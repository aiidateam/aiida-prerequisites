# Explicitly define the node name. This is necessary because the mnesia subdirectory contains the hostname, which by
# default is set to the value of $(hostname -s), which for docker containers, will be a random hexadecimal string. Upon
# restart, this will be different and so the original mnesia folder with the persisted data will not be found. The
# reason RabbitMQ is built this way is through this way it allows to run multiple nodes on a single machine each with
# isolated mnesia directories. Since in the AiiDA setup we only need and run a single node, we can simply use localhost.
